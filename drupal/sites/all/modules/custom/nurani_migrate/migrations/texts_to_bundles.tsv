97	Wisdom	0	67	Wisdom  in  Deuteronomy	5 See, just as the Lord my God has charged me, I now teach you statutes and ordinances for you to observe in the land that you are about to enter and occupy. 6 You must observe them diligently, for this will show your wisdom and discernment to the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people!’ 7 For what other great nation has a god so near to it as the Lord our God is whenever we call to him? 8 And what other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am setting before you today?

97	Wisdom	1	69	Wisdom in 1  Corinthians	17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to proclaim the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its power.18 For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19 For it is written,‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,   and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.’ 20 Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. 22 For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, 23 but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling-block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24 but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25 For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.26 Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. 27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; 28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, 29 so that no one* might boast in the presence of God.	1 Corinthians 1:17-29 NT text from SR text pack
97	Wisdom	2	71	Wisdom in the Qur'an	8 Of the people there are some who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day’; but they do not (really) believe. 9 Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves, and realise (it) not! 10 In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: and grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves). 11 When it is said to them: ‘Make not mischief on the earth’, they say: ‘Why, we only want to make peace!’ 12 Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise (it) not. 13 When it is said to them: ‘Believe as the others believe’: they say: ‘Shall we believe as the fools believe?’ Nay, of a surety they are the fools, but they do not know. 14 When they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe’; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say: ‘We are really with you: we (were) only jesting.’ 15 Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (to and fro). 16 These are they who have bartered guidance for error: but their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction, 17 Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see. 18 Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).	2:8–18 Qur'anic text from SR text pack on Wisdom
99	Light	0	73	Light (Genesis)	In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, 2 the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. 3 Then God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

101	Welcoming strangers	0	79	Hospitality	The Lord appeared to Abraham* by the oaks* of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day. 2He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent entrance to meet them, and bowed down to the ground. 3He said, ‘My lord, if I find favour with you, do not pass by your servant. 4Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. 5Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.’ So they said, ‘Do as you have said.’ 6And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, ‘Make ready quickly three measures* of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes.’ 7Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. 8Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.9 They said to him, ‘Where is your wife Sarah?’ And he said, ‘There, in the tent.’ 10Then one said, ‘I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son.’ And Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him. 11Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 12So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, ‘After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?’ 13The Lord said to Abraham, ‘Why did Sarah laugh, and say, “Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?” 14Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son.’ 15But Sarah denied, saying, ‘I did not laugh’; for she was afraid. He said, ‘Oh yes, you did laugh.’Judgement Pronounced on Sodom16 Then the men set out from there, and they looked towards Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way.

101	Welcoming strangers	1	81	Abraham's faith	3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible.*The Examples of Abel, Enoch, and Noah4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable* sacrifice than Cain’s. Through this he received approval as righteous, God himself giving approval to his gifts; he died, but through his faith* he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken so that he did not experience death; and ‘he was not found, because God had taken him.’ For it was attested before he was taken away that ‘he had pleased God.’ 6And without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would approach him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 7By faith Noah, warned by God about events as yet unseen, respected the warning and built an ark to save his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir to the righteousness that is in accordance with faith.The Faith of Abraham8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. 10For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old—and Sarah herself was barren—because he considered him faithful who had promised.* 12Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, ‘as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.’13 All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth,	Hebrews 11:3-13

The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. 4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 5 And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.6 And he said to me, ‘These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place. 7 And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.’[...] 16 ‘I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.’ 17 The Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who hears say, ‘Come.’ And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price. 18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. 20 He who testifies to these things says, ‘Surely I am coming soon.’ Amen.

The leader among them said: ‘Know you not that your father did take an oath from you in God’s name, and how, before this, you did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command. 81 ‘Turn back to your father, and say, “O our father! Behold!

We bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen! 82 “Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth”.’ 83 Jacob said: ‘Nay, but you have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So beautiful patience is most fitting (for me). Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end). For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom.’ 84 And he turned away from them, and said: ‘How great is my grief for Joseph!’ And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy. 85 They said: ‘By Allah, (never) will you cease to remember Joseph until you reach the last extremity of illness, or until you die!’ 86 He said: ‘I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you know not ... 87 ‘O my sons! Go and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of God’s soothing mercy: truly no one despairs of God’s soothing mercy, except those who have no faith.’	Quran

Speak if you have any understanding. 5 Do you know who fixed its dimensions Or who measured it with a line? 6 Onto what were its bases sunk? Who set its cornerstone? 7 When the morning stars sang together And all the divine beings shouted for joy? 8 Who closed the sea behind doors When it gushed forth out of the womb, 9 When I clothed it in clouds, Swaddled it in dense clouds, 10 When I made breakers My limit for it, And set up its bars and doors, 11 And said, “You may come so far and no farther; Here your surging waves will stop”? 12 Have you ever commanded the day to break, Assigned the dawn its place 13 So that it seizes the corners of the earth And shakes the wicket out of it? 14 It changes like clay under the seal Till [its hues] are fixed like those of a garment. 15 Their light is withheld from the wicked, And the upraised arm is broken. 16 Have you penetrated to the sources of the sea, Or walked in the recesses of the deep? 17 Have the gates of death been disclosed to you? Have you seen the gates of deep darkness? 18 Have you surveyed the expanses of the earth? If you know of these- tell Me. 19 Which path leads to where light dwells, And where is the place of darkness, 20 That you may take it to its domain And know the way to its home?Job 40, 1-91 The LORD said in reply to Job.2 a- Shall one who should be disciplined complain against Shaddai? -a He who arraigns God must respond. 3 Job said in reply to the LORD: 4 See, I am of small worth; what can I answer You?I clap my hand to my mouth. 5 I have spoken once, and will not reply; Twice, and will do so no more. 6 Then the LORD replied to Job out of the tempest and said: 7 Gird your loins like a man; I will ask and you will inform Me. 8 Would you impugn My justice? Would you condemn Me that you might be right? 9 Have you an arm like God’s? Can you thunder with a voice like His? 	Old Testament
107	Creation	1	95	Creation 	16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel; it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed through faith for faith; as it is written, "The one who is righteous will live by faith." 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth.19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20 Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made. So they are without excuse; 21 for though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their senseless minds were darkened. 22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools; 23 and they exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling a mortal human being or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles.24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves, 25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. 26 For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural,27 and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error. 28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind and to things that should not be done. 29 They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious toward parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 They know God's decree, that those who practice such things deserve to die, yet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them.

He fell at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come to his house, 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As he went, the crowds pressed in on him. 43 Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years; and though she had spent all she had on physicians, no one could cure her. 44 She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped. 45 Then Jesus asked, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds surround you and press in on you.” 46 But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.” 47 When the woman saw that she could not remain hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him, she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. 48 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.” 49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.” 50 When Jesus heard this, he replied, “Do not fear. Only believe, and she will be saved.” 51 When he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him, except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother. 52 They were all weeping and wailing for her; but he said, “Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.” 53 And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. 54 But he took her by the hand and called out, “Child, get up!” 55 Her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he directed them to give her something to eat. 56 Her parents were astounded; but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened. 	NULL

Live with them honourably in the world, but follow the way of him who turns to Me. Your returning is to Me in the end, when I will tell you what you did. 16. "O my son, whatsoever it may be, even though equal to a mustard seed in weight, or within a rock or in the sky or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily God is perceptive, all-aware. 17. O my son, fulfil your moral obligations, bid what is known to be right and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience what befalls you. These are indeed acts of courage and resolve. 18. Do not hold men in contempt, and do not walk with hauteur on the earth. Verily God does not like the proud and boastful. 19. Be moderate in your bearing, and keep your voice low. Surely the most repulsive voice is the donkey's."English Translation: Ahmed Ali, 2001	Muslim text

Show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be boastful and false to the truth. 15 Such wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, devilish. 16 For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there will also be disorder and wickedness of every kind. 17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</p><p>English Translation: NRSV</p>	Christian text
2875	Group 15(Wisdom)	0	2873	Luqman 31:12-19	12. We bestowed wisdom on Luqman that he may be grateful to God. Whosoever is grateful is so for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful (should remember) that God is above all concern, worthy of praise. 13.(Remember) when Luqman counselled his son: "O son, do not associate any one with God. To associate others with God is a grievous wrong." 14. We have committed man about his parents. His mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility, weaning him in two years.
