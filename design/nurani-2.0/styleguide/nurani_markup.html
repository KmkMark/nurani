					<h3>Exodus 3:1-8 (Hebrew Bible)</h3>
					<p>1 Now Moses, tending the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian, drove the flock into the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 2 An angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire out of a bush. He gazed, and there was a bush all aflame, yet the bush was not consumed.  3 Moses said, "I must turn aside to look at this marvelous sight; why doesn't the bush burn up?"  4 When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush: "Moses! Moses!" He answered, "Here I am."  5 And He said, "Do not come closer. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground.  6 He said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. 7 And the LORD continued, "I have marked well the plight of My people in Egypt and have heeded their outcry because of their taskmasters; yes, I am mindful of their sufferings.  8 I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the region of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

					<h3>Ta Ha 20:9-23 (Qur'an)</h3>
					<p>
						9. Has the story of Moses come to you? 10. When he saw a fire he said to his family: "You wait here. I have seen a fire. I may be able to bring an ember from it, or find direction by the fire." 11. When he approached it, a voice called out:  12."O Moses, I am verily your Lord, so take off your shoes, for you are in the holy plain of Towa. 13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed to you. 14. I am God, and there is no god but I, so serve Me, and observe acts of prayer to remember Me. 15.Verily the Hour (of the great change) is about to come. I keep it secret that every soul may be rewarded for its endeavour. 16. So do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires, turn you away from it. 17. What is that in your right band, O Moses?" 18. "It's my staff," he answered; "I lean on it, and fell leaves for my goats with it, and I have other uses for it." 19. "Throw it down, O Moses," said (the Voice). 20. So he threw it down, and lo, it became a running serpent. 21. "Catch it," said He, "and have no fear; We shall revert it to its former state. 22. And face what is to come with patience, your hand will not be tarnished with blame: Another sign 23. That We may go on showing you Our greater signs. (English Translation: Ahmed Ali)

					<h3>Acts 9:1-9 (New Testament)</h3>
					<p>1 Meanwhile Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest  2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.  3 Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.  4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"  5 He asked, "Who are you, Lord?" The reply came, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.  6 But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."  7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one.  8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.  9 For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
